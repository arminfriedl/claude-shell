`claude-shell` Provides access to all Claude 3 models (Haiku, Sonnet and Opus).
The most interesting of which is probably Haiku which provides near instant
answers while still being of good quality. Similar in speed to Kagi's FastGPT
while providing subjectively better answers. 

Meanwhile Opus and ChatGPT seem to fight for the crown of the best foundational
model in general, but they tend to be sluggish enough to break the flow.


Everything below this line was written by Claude 3 Opus.

I'll clean it up later. Promise. ðŸ¤ž
